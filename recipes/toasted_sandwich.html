        <h2>Ingredients required:</h2>
        <p>Here are the main ingredients required for this recipe. I am keeping the recipe simple with ham and cheese, however you can add what you like. You can find these at your local supermarket.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread (any kind of bread will work for this)</li>
            <li>Fillings (e.g ham, bacon, cheese, egg)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>A sauce of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter two slices of bread, on one side of each slice.
            </li>
            <li>Lay one slice of bread butter-side down and add your fillings.
            </li>
            <li>Add sauce if preferred.
            </li>
            <li>Place the sandwich onto a sandwich press. Ensure the butter side is making contact with the press.
            </li>
            <li>Add the second slide of bread, butter-side up so that it makes contact with the top side of the press.
            </li>
            <li>Allow the sandwich to toast until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
