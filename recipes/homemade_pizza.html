        <p>Who doesn't love a good pizza? Whilst it <em>is</em> customary to buy a pizza from your local shop and sit down with a few drinks on a Friday night, we all know that can get expensive. Here, I'll show you how to make one at home; same quality, for a fraction of the price.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients required:</h2>
        <p>Here are the main ingredients required for this recipe. You can find these at your local supermarket:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A pizza base (any base will work)</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce</li>
            <li>Your chosen toppings (e.g cheese, ham, pepperoni)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay the pizza base out on a pizza tray.
            </li>
            <li>Smother the base with pizza sauce. It's best to use a spoon here.
            </li>
            <li>Add the cheese and ensure the entire pizza is covered.
            </li>
            <li>Add toppings to the pizza. The more, the better. Remember, this is <em>your</em> pizza, and nobody can take that away from you.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza in the oven and cook for 10-15 minutes or until cooked to your preference.</li>
        </ol>
